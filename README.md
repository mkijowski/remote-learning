### Panopto

share videos with students.  Panopto is the recording solution currently used
in room 339 Russ and can record directly to your Pilot course.

* [Accessing Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Accessing-Panopto)
* [Recording videos with Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Recording-videos-with-Panopto)
* [Re-using videos already in Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Re-using-videos-already-in-Panopto)
* [Uploading videos to Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Uploading-videos-to-Panopto)

#### How to add Panopto to your course
If you are combining your classes (in class and online OR undergrad and grad) 
please do so first so that your lectures go to the correct folder.  If you need 
assistance combining your classes in Pilot, and fill out the [Pilot Course Cross-Listing Request (for faculty)](https://wrightstate.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_category_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_parent%3D308c64bc13e2c30000263482e144b0b8%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_Service_Cat)
 request.

In your Pilot course, go to Content.  Create or select a Module you would like 
students to access Panopto from.  In your Module, select the **Add Existing Activities** 
dropdown, then select **External Learning Tools**.  In the Add Activity pop-up, select 
**Panopto**.  This will create a link in your module called **Panopto**.  Click through 
the link (this may take a moment to load).  You should now see an embedded 
version of your Panopto folder in Pilot.  

#### Accessing Panopto
Sign in to pilot.
To get access to additional tools, **after** signing in to pilot browse to 
[http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/](http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/) 
and select **sign in with Pilot**.
