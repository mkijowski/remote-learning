### Wright State University - Department of Computer Science
Wright state is suspending face-to-face courses and transitioning to remote 
delivery starting on March 16, 2020.  This repository will serve as a starting 
point for documentation and instructions for popular tools to help prepare your
course for remote delivery.

If you need help with any of these, or if you need hardware (camera, 
microphone, etc.) to support  please contact

### Panopto
Panopto is a video sharing platform used to record, live stream, manage, and 
share videos with students.  Panopto is the recording solution currently used
in room 339 Russ and can record directly to your Pilot course.

Quick facts:
* campus authentication using w#
* integrates with pilot
* mostly web hosted, requires standalone installation for recording

Topics for Panopto:
* [How to add Panopto to your course](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#how-to-add-panopto-to-your-course)
* [Accessing Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Accessing-Panopto)

* [Re-using videos already in Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Re-using-videos-already-in-Panopto)
* [Uploading videos to Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Uploading-videos-to-Panopto)
* [Editing videos in Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Editing-videos-in-Panopto)
* [Center for Teaching and Learning Panopto Tutorials (wright.edu link)](https://www.wright.edu/center-for-teaching-and-learning/resources/panopto-tutorials)

#### How to add Panopto to your course
If you are combining your classes (in class and online OR undergrad and grad) 
please do so first so that your lectures go to the correct folder.  If you need 
assistance combining your classes in Pilot, and fill out the [Pilot Course Cross-Listing Request (for faculty)](https://wrightstate.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_category_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_parent%3D308c64bc13e2c30000263482e144b0b8%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_Service_Cat)
 request.

In your Pilot course, go to Content.  Create or select a Module you would like 
students to access Panopto from.  In your Module, select the **Add Existing Activities** 
dropdown, then select **External Learning Tools**.  In the Add Activity pop-up, select 
**Panopto**.  This will create a link in your module called **Panopto**.  Click through 
the link (this may take a moment to load).  You should now see an embedded 
version of your Panopto folder in Pilot.  

#### Accessing Panopto
Sign in to pilot.
To get access to additional tools, **after** signing in to pilot browse to 
[http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/](http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/) 
and select **sign in with Pilot**.

#### Recording videos with Panopto
Either sign into pilot and go to your Panopto module or sign into the Panopto hosted site.
Select the Create button.  From here you can:
* **Record a New Session** which will require you to download the Panopto application.  
  Windows and Mac have applications.  Linux users will need to use an alternative 
  capture program and then upload their content.  Once the app is installed, you 
  will need to log in with Pilot.  This will open up a browser for authentication.  
  Once you have logged in to Pilot in the browser, you may need to open the verification link provided by the app to finish the sign in process.
  Panopto has a beta capture recording that is browser based.  As it is beta we have limited experience / ability to assist.

#### Uploading videos to Panopto
Follow the Recording instructions above and select the second option:
* **Upload Media** allows you to upload content from other platforms - Panopto will let you know if you are using a format it does not support.

#### Re-using videos already in Panopto
Sign into pilot, then into [http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/](http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/).
Browse to the class you wish to pull videos from.  You can **bulk Copy** or **Move** 
the videos to the course where they are needed.

#### Editing videos in Panopto
Sign into pilot, then into [http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/](http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/).
Browse to the video you would like to edit and click the edit button.
All edits in Panopto are non-destructive, meaning they can be un-done.  You 
can use this video editing web interface to cut out portions of your video 
before publishing it to students.

### Camtasia
Camtasia is a solution to create screen recordings along with capturing the 
audio from your computer's microphone.  Because there is no distribution method,
this tool will require another system like [Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#panopto) to deliver the videos to students.

Because of this added complexity we recommend using the provided Panopto recorder to capture and edit videos.

The last time I worked with Camtasia, our campus license required your system 
to be on Active Directory.

### Blackboard Collaborate Ultra
A virtual classroom built into every Pilot course, Blackboard Collaborate Ultra offers the follwoing features:  
* Screen Sharing
* Virtual whiteboard
* File sharing
* Polling (multiple choice and yes/no
* Breakout groups
* voice and text chat
* session recording

Information can be found here: 
[https://www.wright.edu/center-for-teaching-and-learning/resources/blackboard-collaborate-ultra](https://www.wright.edu/center-for-teaching-and-learning/resources/blackboard-collaborate-ultrahttps://www.wright.edu/center-for-teaching-and-learning/resources/blackboard-collaborate-ultra)

### Webex
Cisco Webex is a web conferencing platform that supports scheduled and live 
web conferencing, including voice, video, and screen sharing among a number of 
individuals.  This service may not work best for large groups but will provide 
a way to have virtual office hours with individual and small groups of students.
This solution is licensed through CaTS and available to all WSU faculty.  

Quick facts:
* campus authentication using w#
* can use both website or standalone application

Topics for webex:
* [CaTS Cisco Webex instructions](https://www.wright.edu/information-technology/services/cisco-webex-meeting-center).
* [Wright State Webex portal: http://wright.webex.com/](http://wright.webex.com/)
* [Using your Webex meeting room](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Using-your-Webex-meeting-room)

#### Using your Webex meeting room
A neat feature of our partnership with webex, you get your own personal meeting room with the following type of link:
[https://wright.webex.com/meet/matthew.kijowski](https://wright.webex.com/meet/matthew.kijowski).  
Note: this link will put you in a waiting room until the owner of the link signs in to begin the meeting.

### Discord
Discord is a voice and text chat solution that is popular with gamers.  The big 
benefit of Discord (besides being free) is it allows students to communicate 
with one another synchronously via voice or asynchronously via text without the
instructor needing to manage it.  This allows students to help each other out
and can reduce the load on the instructor.

Here is an example discord server invite: [https://discord.gg/xcgpNSV](https://discord.gg/xcgpNSV)
