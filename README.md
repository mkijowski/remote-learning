### Panopto
Panopto is a video sharing platform used to record, live stream, manage, and 
share videos with students.  Panopto is the recording solution currently used
in room 339 Russ and can record directly to your Pilot course.

##### Quick facts:
* campus authentication using w#
* integrates with pilot
* mostly web hosted, requires standalone installation for recording

##### Topics for Panopto:
* [How to add Panopto to your course](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#how-to-add-panopto-to-your-course)
* [Accessing Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Accessing-Panopto)
* [Recording videos with Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Recording-videos-with-Panopto)
* [Re-using videos already in Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Re-using-videos-already-in-Panopto)
* [Uploading videos to Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Uploading-videos-to-Panopto)
* [Editing videos in Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Editing-videos-in-Panopto)
* [Center for Teaching and Learning Panopto Tutorials (wright.edu link)](https://www.wright.edu/center-for-teaching-and-learning/resources/panopto-tutorials)

#### How to add Panopto to your course
If you are combining your classes (in class and online OR undergrad and grad) 
please do so first so that your lectures go to the correct folder.  If you need 
assistance combining your classes in Pilot, and fill out the [Pilot Course Cross-Listing Request (for faculty)](https://wrightstate.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_category_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_parent%3D308c64bc13e2c30000263482e144b0b8%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_Service_Cat)
 request.

In your Pilot course, go to Content.  Create or select a Module you would like 
students to access Panopto from.  In your Module, select the **Add Existing Activities** 
dropdown, then select **External Learning Tools**.  In the Add Activity pop-up, select 
**Panopto**.  This will create a link in your module called **Panopto**.  Click through 
the link (this may take a moment to load).  You should now see an embedded 
version of your Panopto folder in Pilot.  

#### Accessing Panopto
Sign in to pilot.
To get access to additional tools, **after** signing in to pilot browse to 
[http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/](http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/) 
and select **sign in with Pilot**.

#### Recording videos with Panopto
Either sign into pilot and go to your Panopto module or sign into the Panopto hosted site.
Select the Create button.  From here you can:
* **Record a New Session** which will require you to download the Panopto application.  
  Windows and Mac have applications.  Linux users will need to use an alternative 
  capture program and then upload their content.  Once the app is installed, you 
  will need to log in with Pilot.  This will open up a browser for authentication.  
  Once you have logged in to Pilot in the browser, you may need to open the verification link provided by the app to finish the sign in process.
  Panopto has a beta capture recording that is browser based.  As it is beta we have limited experience / ability to assist.

#### Uploading videos to Panopto
Follow the Recording instructions above and select the second option:
* **Upload Media** allows you to upload content from other platforms - Panopto will let you know if you are using a format it does not support.

#### Re-using videos already in Panopto
Sign into pilot, then into [http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/](http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/).
Browse to the class you wish to pull videos from.  You can **bulk Copy** or **Move** 
the videos to the course where they are needed.

#### Editing videos in Panopto
Sign into pilot, then into [http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/](http://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/).
Browse to the video you would like to edit and click the edit button.
All edits in Panopto are non-destructive, meaning they can be un-done.  You 
can use this video editing web interface to cut out portions of your video 
before publishing it to students.

### Blackboard Collaborate Ultra
A virtual classroom built into every Pilot course (under Communications, if you 
do not have Communication tab enabled need to add this as a content module).

##### Quick facts:
* Pilot integration
* Ideal for synchronous teaching (also allows recording session for
  asynchronous viewing)
* Can **not** edit recorded sessions
* Full screen or per application sharing
* support web cams in addition to above screen share (web cam and microphone are
  turned off by default, need to turn on at bottom of screen in session)
* Virtual whiteboard (OneNote is better)
* File sharing
* Live polling (multiple choice and yes/no)
* Breakout groups
* voice and text chat

##### Topics for Blackboard Collaborate Ultra: 
* [CTL Instructions](https://www.wright.edu/center-for-teaching-and-learning/resources/blackboard-collaborate-ultrahttps://www.wright.edu/center-for-teaching-and-learning/resources/blackboard-collaborate-ultra)
* [CTL instructional video

### Webex
Cisco Webex is a web conferencing platform that supports scheduled and live 
web conferencing, including voice, video, and screen sharing among a number of 
individuals.  This service may not work best for large groups but will provide 
a way to have virtual office hours with individual and small groups of students.
This solution is licensed through CaTS and available to all WSU faculty.  

##### Quick facts:
* campus authentication using w#
* can use both website or standalone application
* email alerts when someon is in your meeting room
* scheduleable meetings

##### Topics for Webex:
* [CaTS Cisco Webex instructions](https://www.wright.edu/information-technology/services/cisco-webex-meeting-center).
* [Wright State Webex portal: http://wright.webex.com/](http://wright.webex.com/)
* [Using your Webex meeting room](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#Using-your-Webex-meeting-room)
* [Using Webex for private meetings
  FERPA](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#using-webex-for-private-meetings)

#### Using your Webex meeting room
A neat feature of our license with webex, you get your own personal meeting room with the following type of link:
[https://wright.webex.com/meet/matthew.kijowski](https://wright.webex.com/meet/matthew.kijowski).

You may need to sign in to webex using the above portal once before you can use
this link.  This link will put you in a waiting room until the owner of the link 
signs in to begin the meeting.

You can also schedule a meeting in the future and get a unique meeting link to
share to invitees.  Similarly to your personal meeting room, the meeting will
not start until you sign in, early arivals will be put in a waiting area until
you begin the meeting.

#### Using Webex for private meetings
For meetings that might involve private data (grades, etc.), the above Webex
meeting room is not secure since names are user selected and not validated.  To
ensure the other users you are meeting with are who they say they are you can
schedule a meeting with them by entering their campus email in the participants
field when scheduleing a webex meeting.  This sends them a unique meeting invite
link to their campus email.

### Discord
Discord is a voice and text chat solution that supports a lot of customization of user roles and permissions.  The big 
benefit of Discord (besides being free) is it allows students to communicate 
with one another synchronously via voice or asynchronously via text without the
instructor needing to manage it.  This allows students to help each other out
and can reduce the load on the instructor.

##### Quick facts:
* web appliance or local installation options
* requires registering an account with discord
* can post an invite link to pilot
* allows students to communicate without instructor present

##### Topics for Discord:
* Here is the official WSU CS Discord server (feel free to place this link in your pilot page): 
  [https://discord.gg/ks3pV7G](https://discord.gg/ks3pV7G)

### OneNote
Microsoft OneNote Class Notebook is a program for sharing static and live collaborative whiteboards.

##### Quick facts:
* integrates with Pilot as an external learning tool
* as an instructor, the first time you access in a class you will need to sign
  in with your campus w#
* From here you can create a class notebook
* Class notebooks open in the OneNote web app, but has a button labeled *open in
  app* to launch a local OneNote instalaltion
* **Collaboration Space** is for notebooks that can be edited by everyone in
  real time
* **Content Library** is for content that is only editable by the instructor
* each student gets their own notebook for copying instructor notes to and
  editing them.  Instructor can see each students private notebooks.

##### Topics for OneNote:
* [Microsoft's OneNote walkthrough for teachers](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/getting-started-with-the-onenote-class-notebook-a-walkthrough-for-teachers-28666b8e-b0ae-48fe-b001-1874f5f6db58)

### Camtasia
Camtasia is a solution to create screen recordings along with capturing the 
audio from your computer's microphone.  Because there is no distribution method,
this tool will require another system like [Panopto](https://github.com/mkijowski/remote-learning#panopto) to deliver the videos to students.

Because of this added complexity we recommend using the provided Panopto recorder to capture and edit videos.

The last time I worked with Camtasia, our campus license required your system 
to be on Active Directory.
